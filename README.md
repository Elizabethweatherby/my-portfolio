This is a README for my Personal Portfolio. I created the webpage to showcase my work hard work and skills to future employers. At the top of this README you will see my
name, my picture, and a navigational menu at the top, and when clicked on one the topics, will scroll you down to the corresponding part of the webpage to that section. in the 'work' section, I do not have any work thus far to link to, but the links should still function. The webpage should also be responsive to different viewports. Checkout the dev tools to inspect! At the bottom of the page you will see my contact info. Thanks for reading!
